  flavorText: "It looks like our angry letter provoked a response. . .in name alone.
    Here's what we got:\n\"Dearest Rock Administrator,\n\tDespite it being the year
    2257 government facilities such as ours still use fax machines, surprising though
    it may sound. As such, the evacuation paperwork for the rock that you call a spaceport
    is very flammable and I would sincerely suggest you do other things with your
    time than waste mine if you at all value the idea of said paperwork being processed.\"\n\tXOXO\n\t-Bridgette"
