  effectTitle: 'Tutorial 4: Other OTHER buildings'
  effectText: "There are still a few buildings we haven't gone over yet: The Bunkhouse,
    Saloon, and Storage. The bunkhouse provides more space for families, allowing
    your population to grow (if you ever run out of workers we're done for!) The Saloon
    keeps the people happy, slightly increasing production of every resource. Finally,
    Storage expands your resource capacity, making sure no produce ever goes to waste!
    \nIt's a good idea to make at least one of each building early on to make sure
    you have good supplies across the board."
