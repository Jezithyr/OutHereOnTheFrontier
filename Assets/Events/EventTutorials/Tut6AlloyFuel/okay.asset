  effectTitle: 'Tutorial: Fuel and Alloy'
  effectText: 'We have the means to produce a rocket ship that can carry us and our
    citizens off the moon and away from danger! The only catch is we need Alloy and
    Fuel to make it work. You can build factories for each from the build menu. Be
    warned: The Fuel Factory consumes Wood and Air to make fuel, and the Alloy Factory
    does the same with Metal and Air. Make sure you''ve got enough production to outpace
    the consumption before building! To make the rocket we''ll need 1,000 of each
    resource.'
