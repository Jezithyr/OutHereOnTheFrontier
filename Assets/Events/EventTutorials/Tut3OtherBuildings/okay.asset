  effectTitle: Station Administrator off to a good start!
  effectText: 'Life on the frontier is decided by your resources, namely in WHAT you
    have and HOW MUCH. Metal and Wood are the building blocks of every structure,
    but they aren''t all that matters! Windmills and Water Towers produce Air and
    Water respectively, which can be combined to make food with a Food Farm. The Sheriff''s
    office doesn''t produce resources, but it opens up the option to solve some situations
    in a more LAWFUL manner. More on that later though!

    As an aside: it''s never a bad idea to spend your excess resources building extra
    structures -- having more of the same building means you''ll gather resources
    faster and be better prepared for all the strange and zany "issues" that crop
    up in space!'
